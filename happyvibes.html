    <li><h3>Brighter Than The Sun</h3></li>
    <h4>by: Colbie Caillat</h4>
    Colbie Caillat's 'Brighter Than The Sun' is a jubilant celebration of love and the serendipity of finding it when least expected. The song's lyrics convey the sudden and powerful impact of new love, likening it to a vision that strikes unexpectedly. Caillat uses vivid imagery, such as lightning striking the heart and the brightness of the sun, to express the intensity and brilliance of these emotions. The song suggests that love is a force of nature, unpredictable and overwhelming in its beauty.

    <li><h3>Happy</h3></li>
    <h4>by: Pharrell Williams</h4>
    “When I do a song, if my wife is there at the studio with me, we’ll leave and then we’ll listen to it one time when we’re out. So we listened to [Happy] and we ended up driving round for an hour and a half [listening to it] and we were like, I don’t know what this is, but it feels good,” Williams said.

    <li><h3>God of Music</h3></li>
    <h4>by: Seventeen</h4>
    Punchy feel-good energy is how I would describe God of Music. The song made me do a bit of a boogie within the first listen. More repeats of the song since its release has me practically up and dancing. The liveliness of God of Music is thanks to the soul funk genre that the group went with. Plus God of Music had some extra lively elements that really helped enhance the energy and brightness of the song, such as the electric guitar riffs in the pre-choruses, the brass detailing in the background and that retro synthesizer riff in the instrumental break.
    
    <li><h3>Dance with Me</h3></li>
    <h4>by: Alex Blue</h4>
    This song is so uplifting and cheerful! It makes me feel like dancing around the living room, letting the sunlight pour in through the windows, all while enjoying a warm, comforting sip of coffee. It's the perfect way to start the day with positive energy and joy.

    <li><h3>Elbi Foodtrip</h3></li>
    <h4>by: Kolar!s</h4>
    This song brings back such strong feelings of nostalgia. It takes me right back to the good old days with my friend in high school. Every time I hear it, I'm flooded with memories of those carefree times, the laughter, and the adventures we shared. Those were truly the best days, filled with unforgettable moments and a sense of freedom that only high school life could offer.

    <li><h3>Cherry on Top</h3></li>
    <h4>by: BINI</h4>
    BINI's latest single is an absolute hit! The song radiates such an infectious, upbeat vibe that it makes you want to dance even if you don't know the choreography. The energetic rhythm and catchy melody are impossible to resist, making it a perfect addition to any playlist. Whether you're a longtime fan or just discovering their music, this track is sure to get you on your feet and moving to the beat.

    <li><h3>How Sweet</h3></li>
    <h4>by: New Jeans</h4>
    This is an incredibly catchy and funky song, quickly becoming one of my favorite tracks in the K-pop genre. The blend of infectious rhythms and stylish beats creates a cool, refreshing sound. Unlike some songs that can become grating with repeated listens, this track remains enjoyable and fresh, never irritating to the ears. The seamless production and captivating melody make it a standout hit that you’ll want to play on repeat.
    
    <li><h3>Tip Toe</h3></li>
    <h4>by: Hybs</h4>
    This song is perfect for slow mornings. Its calm and soothing melody sets a peaceful tone, yet it never becomes boring. There’s something about this track that effortlessly lifts your mood, providing just the right amount of gentle energy to start your day on a positive note. The subtle nuances and relaxing rhythms create a comforting atmosphere, making it an ideal choice for easing into your morning routine with a sense of tranquility and upliftment.
